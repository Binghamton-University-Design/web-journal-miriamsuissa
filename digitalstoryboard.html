	            <p>For my project, as mentioned in my design brief, I am telling a narrative architectural story about my life as a structure. Therefore, for my project I divided up the house into the four main sections of my life spaning from my childhood to m present life in college. For the fifth section, I am leaving the top of the house "unfinished" as I want to explain how my "house" of life is not over/ completed and I dont know where life will exactly take me. What you see down below in both my sketches and digital example of the foundation/childhood potion of my life is how I plan to have my website be visualized.</p>

	            <p>I would like to utilize Java Script and show that as you scroll down the page, each section of the house will be animated as if it is being built. Furthermore, I have also included a timeline on the right hand side of the screen so that if the viewer wishes, they are able to jup ahead or go back without ahving to scroll through all the sections. As I started to think about what I would like to be animated in my website, I had also decided that I would like the text that is in the center to also drop down and fade out and the side arrow text to also be animated in and out of the screen as you scroll down.</p>

	            <p>For the design and aesthetic portion of my website, I am not sure if I am keeping to this exact color scheme, but I did want it to look like a notepad. sketchpad since my drawings have a more hand drawn feel to them, as if they were drawn on a physical notepad. The font I used for this project will also be 'DarkModeOn' since I like the modern clean look to it. Enjoy!</p>

	            <p>Here are the images of my sketches and scroll further down to see the first section and digital layout of my website!</p>
