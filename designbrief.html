	            <h3><a href="">Proposed Design Brief</a></h3>
	            <p>	For my design brief, I would like to create a personal website about my life and structure. Therefore, since I wanted to keep it at a personal level as well and I have a passion for architecture, I would like to create a house that represents my structural growth. The structure behind my website will be primarily in sequence order since I would like it to be that as you scroll, each element of the house will be added along with information about that stage of my life. Artistically, as I was thinking about how I would like it to be a balck and white sketch/draft styled website, it almost looks like I am drawing it as the user is scrolling through the website.</p>

	            <p>Focusing on structure and content, I would like to divide it into four main sections: family/birth, school, gap year in Israel, and college. For each section I will divide it up into different pieces of the house along with information about that stage in my life as well as things that I learned and people who affected my life in that moment. Discussing my family and where I started, I would like that to be the foundation of this house and explain how I grew up in a suburban neighborhood with my two parents who are both deaf. Furthermore, some lessons I learned from my parents and where I came from will also be included like how I was always raised to not care about what other people perceived/ made me out to be as well as how I should always do what makes me happy while being conscious about my actions doing so. For the second portion of the house, as you scroll down the screen the first floor of the house will be added and that will be talking about my grade school experience. For this section, I want to talk about how it was a very intense and hard time in my life because I would always constantly be trying to find myself and who I was, but in the end when I was a senior in high school, I finally saw who I truly was and realized my passion for art and had a great group of friends who I still hang out with today. For my third section which is the second floor of the house I will be talking about my gap year I spent in Israel. In this section, I want to talk about how it was such an amazing experience where I got to learn so much about a new culture and meet so many people from different parts of the world. Furthermore, I also want to talk about how it was a great point in my life where I got to travel to other countries in Europe and see all the different cultures and eat different foods. For the last section of my house, I want to talk about my college experience here at Binghamton University, In this section I want to talk about my major changes from Psychology to Graphic Design and Art History, the people who make me the happiest as well as understanding who I am as a person and how I want to spend my life. This section will probably be the longest since it is the most important and influential part of my life and I want to talk about all my transitions and growth during this stage. And lastly, I would like to keep the roof part either floating or non-existent in this last section. The reason for this is because I would like to explain that that is the next part of my life and how I am very undecided with what I exactly want to do, whether that be going to graduate school or taking a gap year. Furthermore, I think that putting the roof on top of my structure wouldn't make any sense because I still have so much more to do and ways to grow that my house isn't exactly complete.</p>

	            <p> I would like my website to encapsulate my life because it makes something much more meaningful and personal to my life and experiences. I do think that while it is made primarily for me to enjoy, it is also intended for other people to know a little more about who I am as a persian and for them to also relate to transitional parts of life that everyone experiences. So while it may not be an interactive website, I think people can definitely relate and enjoy it regardless.Below you can find some links to other projects that people have done which demonstrate narrative/interactive architecture to tell a specific story.</p>
