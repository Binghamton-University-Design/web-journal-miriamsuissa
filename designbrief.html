	            <h3><a href="">Proposed Design Brief</a></h3>
	            <p>	For my story board, I would like to create an interactive and informative experience that addresses the unhealthy habits of a college student, mainly focusing on nicotine and alcohol consumption. For my project and website layout, I was inspired by the interactive experience I received from the Inequality website. From this experience, I would like to incorporate similar ideas of putting in statistical probabilities and making the viewer “guess” what is really going on in college campuses. For my web design layout, I would like to utilize a sequence layout, incorporating statistical information as well as questions and answers that viewers can interact with. Therefore, this will be a sequence order of continuous interaction and a play by play of unhealthy habits. Other elements I wish to include are biological effects that can harm the body from nicotine and alcohol consumption, as well as ways to prevent and improve overall health from both of them. The overall purpose of my project is to bring awareness and discuss solutions to the issues presented in college students' everyday lives.</p>

	            <p>To approach this website, since I am doing a sequence style website, I would like it to start with basic questions such as asking if the user is of male or female, age, and how often do they consume alcohol/do they smoke. Following these sets of questions to gauge a little more about them, they will be able to  choose to learn about smoking on college campuses or alcohol consumption on campus. Throughout the whole interactive experience, there will be a narrator which could potentially be an owl with a monocle. Another feature I would like to also incorporate throughout this experience is some humor to keep them engaged throughout the series of questions.</p>

	            <p> Starting with the example of the user choosing alcohol consumption on college campuses, my website will continue the interactive experience such as a poll asking how much do they think college students consume per week followed by amounts of bottles they can choose that they think is the correct amount consumed. They can choose from any choice from anywhere between 1-10 drinks per week. After the user chooses, the narrator will give them an infographic statistic which will then explain the correct answer. According to a 12 Key Rehab study from 2012, the correct answer to this question is that the average college female will consume four drinks per week as a male college student will consume nine drinks per week. Another question that can be asked to the user is how many college students do they think consumes alcohol on a regular basis? To allow the user to interact with this question they will be able to swivel the percentage to range anywhere between 0% to 100% of college students along with a visual depiction of how many college students that actually are in America. Again, according to the 12 Key Rehab 2012 study, the correct answer is an average of 80% of college students in America consume alcohol, which is roughly two times the population of people living in New York City. After a series of these types of questions, the user will be able to answer questions of alcohol overdose on college campuses to let them know how to prevent the dangers of alcohol consumption. According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, thousands of college students are transported to the emergency room each year for alcohol overdose. Furthemore, signs of this dangerous condition can include mental confusion, vomiting, seizures, and irregular breath. Knowing all of this will be helpful and informative for college students who commonly use and abuse alcohol consumption casually.</p>
	            
	            <p>Moving on from alcohol consumption, if the user chooses to learn more about nicotine smoking, it will follow the same sequence and style of questions. For example, one question can ask how many college students does the user think abuses nicotine smoking? This question can then be guessed by the user by choosing different percentages or the same swivel method from the alcohol consumption example. According to the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, the percentage of college-aged adults ranging from 19 to 22 who vaped nicotine is roughly around 22% in 2019, which is among the largest increase in use for any substance reported by this study. After a series of questions and statistical facts, this route will also proceed to inform the user about the long term effects of nicotine addiction as well as ways to improve health and lifestyle changes that can help students overall quit. For example, according to New York Smoke Free, one lifestyle change that students can try is to create new habits or routines like exercising, playing a game, or something that they like to help distract them from vaping.</p>

	            <p>This website will be both informative and interactive through a fun experience for college students and adults who don't necessarily know the harmful dangers that coincide with alcohol consumption and smoking, and if they do know the dangers how they can prevent and learn about counteracting this kind of consumption.</p>
